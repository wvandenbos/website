	  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	  <p><strong>Q: What conditions do chiropractors treat?</strong><br>
      A: Doctors of Chiropractic (DCs) care for patients of all ages, with a variety of health conditions. They are especially well known for their expertise in caring for patients with back pain, neck pain and headaches using&nbsp;their highly skilled manipulations or chiropractic adjustments. DCs also care for patients with a wide range of injuries and disorders of the musculoskeletal system, which includes the muscles, ligaments and joints. These painful conditions may involve or impact the nervous system, which can cause referred pain and dysfunction distant to the region of injury. In addition, chiropractors offer advice to patients on diet, nutrition, exercise, healthy habits, and occupational and lifestyle modification.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p><strong>Q: Does chiropractic treatment require a referral from an MD?</strong><br>
    A: A referral is usually not needed to see a doctor of chiropractic (DC); however, your health plan may have specific referral requirements. You may want to contact your employer&rsquo;s human resources department&mdash;or the insurance plan directly&mdash;to find out if there are referral requirements. Most plans allow you to just call and schedule an appointment with a chiropractor.</p>
	  <p><strong>Q: Is chiropractic treatment appropriate for children?</strong><br>
	    A: Yes, children can benefit from chiropractic care. Children are very physically active and experience many types of falls and blows from activities of daily living as well as from participating in sports. Injuries such as these may cause many symptoms including back and neck pain, stiffness, soreness or discomfort. Chiropractic care is always adapted to the individual patient. In the case of children, it is&nbsp;very gentle.</p>
	  <p><strong>Q: Do insurance plans cover chiropractic?</strong><br>
	    A:&nbsp;Yes. Chiropractic care is included in most health insurance plans, including major medical plans, workers&rsquo; compensation, Medicare, some Medicaid plans, and Blue Cross Blue Shield plans for federal employees, among others. Chiropractic care is also available to active-duty members of the armed forces at more than 60 military bases and is available to veterans at more than 60&nbsp;major veterans medical facilities.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p><strong>Q: How is a chiropractic adjustment performed?</strong><br>
      A: Chiropractic adjustment or manipulation is a manual procedure that utilizes the highly refined skills developed during the doctor of chiropractic&rsquo;s intensive years of chiropractic education. The chiropractic physician typically uses his or her hands or an instrument to manipulate the joints of the body, particularly the spine, in order to restore or enhance joint function. This often helps resolve joint inflammation and reduces the patient's pain. Chiropractic manipulation is a highly controlled procedure that rarely causes discomfort. The chiropractor adapts the procedure to meet the specific needs of each patient. Patients often note positive changes in their symptoms immediately following treatment.&nbsp;</p>
